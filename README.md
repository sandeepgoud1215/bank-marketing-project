# 📊 Banking Data Analysis Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze a banking dataset and predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## 📁 Dataset
- **File:** `bankmarketing.csv`
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (or mention your data source)
- **Target Variable:** `y` (Subscribed: Yes/No)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI / Matplotlib for visualizations
- Flask (for deployment)
- GitHub (for version control)

## 📌 Project Structure
- `BankMarketing.ipynb`: Main notebook with analysis, preprocessing, modeling.
- `bankmarketing.csv`: Dataset used.
- `Banking-Data-Analysis ppt.pptx`: Project presentation.
- `BankingDA.zip`: Compressed project assets.
- `model.pkl`: Trained ML model (not included in repo if >25MB).

## 🔎 Key Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding & Scaling
4. Model Training (Random Forest)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy: 89%)
6. Deployment with Flask
7. Visualizations and Reporting

## 🚀 Results
- **Accuracy:** 89%
- **Precision:** 85%
- **Recall:** 82%
- **F1 Score:** 83%

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Use advanced algorithms (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Implement more visual dashboards
- Use cloud platforms like AWS for scalable deployment
